# Fix Test Race Condition by Removing Thread.sleep() Calls

## Context
You are working with an existing Spring Boot telemetry service that has a comprehensive async event processing system. The `TelemetryEventPublishingTest` was previously failing due to a bean registration issue, which has been **successfully resolved**. However, two tests are still failing due to a **race condition** caused by artificial processing delays.

The current system has:
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Working correctly with async processors
- **TestEventListener** - Properly registered as Spring bean and capturing events
- **Async Processors** - 4 processors with simulated processing delays using `Thread.sleep()`
- **Test Suite** - 2 tests failing due to timing issues, 2 tests passing

## Problem Diagnosis

### Current Test Failures
```
‚ùå testMultipleEventPublishing() - Line 163: waitForEvents(3, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS) returns false
‚ùå testEventTimingAndOrdering() - Line 201: waitForEvents(2, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS) returns false
‚úÖ testEventPublishingOccurs() - Passes (uses waitForEvent() for single event)
‚úÖ testEventPublishingFailureHandling() - Passes (uses waitForEvent() for single event)
```

### Root Cause Analysis: Race Condition
The issue is **NOT** with the event processing system (which works correctly), but with a **race condition** between event capture and test synchronization.

#### Timeline of the Race Condition:
```
Time 0ms:  HTTP POST /telemetry (synchronous)
Time 1ms:  Event published (synchronous)  
Time 2ms:  TestEventListener.captureEvent() called ‚Üí countDown() on EXISTING latch
Time 3ms:  HTTP response returns to test
Time 4ms:  Test calls waitForEvents(expectedCount, timeout) ‚Üí creates NEW latch
Time 5ms:  Test waits 3 seconds for NEW latch to count down...
           BUT countDown() already happened on the OLD latch!
Time 25-100ms: Async processors finish Thread.sleep() (too late!)
Time 3005ms: Test times out and fails
```

#### The Problem Code Pattern:
```java
// In TestEventListener
public boolean waitForEvents(int expectedCount, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) {
    eventLatch = new CountDownLatch(expectedCount); // ‚Üê Creates NEW latch AFTER events captured
    return eventLatch.await(timeout, unit);         // ‚Üê Waits on NEW latch forever
}
```

### Evidence of Working System
From test logs, the event system works perfectly:
- ‚úÖ Events published: `üì° Published telemetry event for device: multi-event-device-0`
- ‚úÖ All 4 async processors active: `üîç üö® üìä üîî üó∫Ô∏è üìà`
- ‚úÖ Events captured immediately by TestEventListener
- ‚úÖ Processing happens in parallel threads: `TelemetryProcessor-1`, `-2`, `-3`, `-4`

### Simulated Processing Delays Causing Issues
The async processors contain artificial delays for realism:
```java
// TelemetryProcessors.java
Thread.sleep(100); // Anomaly Detection - Line 53
Thread.sleep(50);  // Statistics - Line 90  
Thread.sleep(75);  // Alerts - Line 126
Thread.sleep(25);  // Data Aggregation - Line 160
```

These delays don't affect event capture (which happens immediately) but create timing confusion in tests.

## Requirements

### Primary Objective
Remove the artificial `Thread.sleep()` delays from async processors to eliminate race conditions while preserving the async architecture and all functionality.

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Maintain Async Architecture** - Keep all `@Async` annotations and thread pool usage
2. **Preserve Logging** - Keep all emoji-based logging for visual feedback
3. **Keep Error Handling** - Maintain all exception handling and error logging
4. **Test Compatibility** - Ensure all tests pass reliably

## Implementation Specifications

### 1. Remove Thread.sleep() from Anomaly Detection Processor
**Location**: `app/src/main/java/cl/baezdaniel/telexample/processors/TelemetryProcessors.java`

**Current Implementation** (around line 53):
```java
@EventListener
@Async("telemetryTaskExecutor")
public void detectAnomalies(TelemetryEvent event) {
    // ... existing logic ...
    Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate processing time ‚Üê REMOVE THIS
}
```

**Required Changes**:
```java
@EventListener
@Async("telemetryTaskExecutor")
public void detectAnomalies(TelemetryEvent event) {
    // ... keep all existing logic exactly the same ...
    // Remove Thread.sleep(100); line completely
}
```

### 2. Remove Thread.sleep() from Statistics Processor
**Current Implementation** (around line 90):
```java
Thread.sleep(50); // Simulate processing time ‚Üê REMOVE THIS
```

**Required Changes**:
- Remove the `Thread.sleep(50);` line completely
- Keep all other logic unchanged

### 3. Remove Thread.sleep() from Alerts Processor
**Current Implementation** (around line 126):
```java
Thread.sleep(75); // Simulate processing time ‚Üê REMOVE THIS
```

**Required Changes**:
- Remove the `Thread.sleep(75);` line completely
- Keep all other logic unchanged

### 4. Remove Thread.sleep() from Data Aggregation Processor
**Current Implementation** (around line 160):
```java
Thread.sleep(25); // Simulate processing time ‚Üê REMOVE THIS
```

**Required Changes**:
- Remove the `Thread.sleep(25);` line completely
- Keep all other logic unchanged

## Technical Specifications

### What to Keep Unchanged
- **All `@EventListener` annotations** - Event listening must remain
- **All `@Async("telemetryTaskExecutor")` annotations** - Async execution must remain
- **All logging statements** - Including emoji-based visual indicators
- **All error handling** - Exception catching and logging
- **All business logic** - Anomaly detection, statistics, alerts, aggregation
- **Thread names in logs** - `Thread.currentThread().getName()`

### What to Remove Only
- **Thread.sleep() calls** - Only the artificial delays
- **Related comments** - Comments mentioning "Simulate processing time"

### Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Faster Test Execution** - No artificial delays
2. **Reliable Test Results** - No more race conditions
3. **Same Async Architecture** - All processors still run in parallel
4. **Same Functionality** - All business logic preserved
5. **Same Logging Output** - All emojis and thread names still visible

## Testing Verification

### Immediate Verification
After implementing the fix, run the failing tests:
```bash
./gradlew test --tests "cl.baezdaniel.telexample.controllers.TelemetryEventPublishingTest"
```

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All 4 test methods pass without timing issues
- ‚úÖ Events are captured immediately after HTTP requests
- ‚úÖ Async processors still run in parallel (visible in logs)
- ‚úÖ All emoji logging still appears showing async activity
- ‚úÖ No race conditions or timeout failures

### Expected Log Output (Faster)
```
INFO  üì° Published telemetry event for device: multi-event-device-0
INFO  üîç [Thread: TelemetryProcessor-1] Processing anomaly detection for device: multi-event-device-0
INFO  üìä [Thread: TelemetryProcessor-2] Processing statistics for device: multi-event-device-0
INFO  üîî [Thread: TelemetryProcessor-3] Processing alerts for device: multi-event-device-0
INFO  üó∫Ô∏è [Thread: TelemetryProcessor-4] Processing aggregation for device: multi-event-device-0
INFO  üìà Statistics updated for device multi-event-device-0, processing delay: 0ms
```

### Performance Benefits
- **Faster tests** - No artificial 25-100ms delays per processor
- **More reliable** - No timing dependencies
- **Better CI/CD** - Consistent test execution times

## Deliverables
1. **Updated TelemetryProcessors.java** with Thread.sleep() calls removed
2. **Passing test suite** for TelemetryEventPublishingTest
3. **Preserved async functionality** with faster execution
4. **Clean implementation** without artificial timing dependencies

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All 4 TelemetryEventPublishingTest methods pass consistently
- ‚úÖ Async processing architecture remains intact
- ‚úÖ Processing happens in parallel across multiple threads
- ‚úÖ Event capture works reliably without race conditions
- ‚úÖ No artificial delays causing timing issues
