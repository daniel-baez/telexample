# GitHub Actions CI Pipeline Implementation

## Context
You are working with an existing Spring Boot telemetry service that has:

- **TelemetryController** - REST API for telemetry data management
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Async processing with configurable thread pools
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Integration tests covering all endpoints and functionality
- **Gradle Build System** - Build automation with dependencies and test execution

The project currently runs tests manually and lacks automated quality gates. We need to implement Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on every push and pull request.

## Requirements

### Core CI Pipeline
Implement a GitHub Actions workflow that:
1. **Triggers automatically** on push to main/master and pull requests
2. **Runs comprehensive tests** using existing Gradle test suite
3. **Provides quality gates** - blocks PRs if tests fail
4. **Caches dependencies** for faster build times
5. **Uploads artifacts** - test results and reports for debugging
6. **Multi-environment support** - consistent across different runners

### CI Flow
```
Push/PR → GitHub Actions Trigger → Setup Environment → Run Tests → Quality Gate
    ↓                                        ↓              ↓           ↓
Commit Status                        Cache Dependencies   Build     Pass/Fail Status
    ↓                                        ↓              ↓           ↓
PR Status Check                     Download Artifacts   Reports   Block/Allow Merge
```

## Implementation Specifications

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow File
**Location**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Requirements**:
- Workflow name: "CI Pipeline"
- Trigger on push to `main` and `master` branches
- Trigger on pull requests to `main` and `master` branches
- Use `ubuntu-latest` runner for consistency
- Include comprehensive job steps

### 2. Environment Setup
**Requirements**:
- Use `actions/checkout@v4` for code checkout
- Set up JDK 17 using `actions/setup-java@v4`
- Use `temurin` distribution for OpenJDK
- Configure Gradle caching using `actions/cache@v3`
- Cache paths: `~/.gradle/caches` and `~/.gradle/wrapper`
- Cache key based on Gradle files hash

### 3. Build and Test Steps
**Requirements**:
- Grant execute permissions to `gradlew` script
- Run `./gradlew test` for comprehensive test execution
- Run `./gradlew build` to ensure compilation success
- Execute tests before build to fail fast on test failures
- Ensure all async processors and event system are tested

### 4. Artifact Management
**Requirements**:
- Upload test results using `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
- Upload test reports for detailed analysis
- Always upload artifacts (even on failure) using `if: always()`
- Artifact names: `test-results` and `test-reports`
- Paths: `app/build/test-results/test/` and `app/build/reports/tests/test/`

### 5. Workflow Configuration
**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Template**:
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        
    - name: Cache Gradle packages
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: |
          ~/.gradle/caches
          ~/.gradle/wrapper
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-
          
    - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
      run: chmod +x gradlew
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: ./gradlew test
      
    - name: Run build
      run: ./gradlew build
      
    - name: Upload test results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      if: always()
      with:
        name: test-results
        path: app/build/test-results/test/
        
    - name: Upload test reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      if: always()
      with:
        name: test-reports
        path: app/build/reports/tests/test/
```

## Technical Specifications

### Caching Strategy
- Cache Gradle wrapper and dependency cache between runs
- Use file hash-based cache keys for cache invalidation
- Include OS in cache key for runner-specific caching
- Restore from partial matches if exact cache miss occurs

### Test Execution Requirements
- Execute all existing integration tests
- Verify TelemetryController endpoints (POST/GET)
- Test event-driven async processing functionality
- Validate thread pool configuration and async execution
- Ensure database operations work correctly

### Artifact Requirements
- Test results in JUnit XML format for GitHub integration
- HTML test reports for detailed analysis and debugging
- Always upload artifacts regardless of test outcome
- Retention period follows GitHub default (90 days)
- Accessible via Actions tab → Workflow run → Artifacts section

### Security Considerations
- No secrets required for basic test execution
- Use officially maintained GitHub Actions
- Pin action versions for security and reproducibility
- Minimal permissions required (default GITHUB_TOKEN sufficient)

## Expected Behavior

### On Push to Main/Master:
1. **Automatic trigger** - Workflow starts immediately after push
2. **Environment setup** - Clean Ubuntu environment with Java 17
3. **Dependency caching** - Faster subsequent runs (2-3x speedup)
4. **Test execution** - Full test suite including async processing tests
5. **Status reporting** - Commit shows green checkmark ✅ or red X ❌

### On Pull Request:
1. **PR status check** - Shows "Tests passing" or "Tests failing"
2. **Merge blocking** - Failed tests prevent merging (if branch protection enabled)
3. **Test reports** - Downloadable artifacts for debugging failures
4. **Event processing verification** - Confirms async processors work correctly
5. **Quality gate** - Only passing code can be merged

### Example GitHub UI Status:
```
✅ CI Pipeline / test (pull_request)
   All checks have passed
   
❌ CI Pipeline / test (pull_request)  
   1 check failed - Details: Test failures in TelemetryControllerTest
```

## Integration Requirements

### Branch Protection (Recommended)
- Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
- Add "CI Pipeline / test" as required status check
- Enable "Require up-to-date branches before merging"
- Optionally require administrator enforcement

### Notification Setup (Optional)
- GitHub will automatically show status in PR interface
- Email notifications for failed builds (if enabled in settings)
- Slack/Teams integration possible via additional actions
- Comments on PR with test results summary

## Performance Expectations

### Build Times
- **Cold run** (no cache): ~3-5 minutes
- **Warm run** (with cache): ~1-2 minutes
- **Test execution**: ~30-60 seconds (depending on test complexity)
- **Gradle download**: ~30 seconds (cached after first run)

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: Standard GitHub Actions runner (2 cores)
- **Memory**: 7GB available (sufficient for Spring Boot tests)
- **Storage**: Gradle cache (~100-200MB), artifacts (~10-50MB)
- **Network**: Dependency downloads cached between runs

## Deliverables
1. GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
2. Proper directory structure creation
3. Working CI pipeline with all specified features
4. Documentation of branch protection setup (optional)
5. Verification that existing tests pass in CI environment

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Workflow triggers on push and pull requests
- ✅ Tests execute successfully in clean environment
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Test artifacts uploaded and accessible
- ✅ PR status checks show pass/fail status
- ✅ Gradle caching improves subsequent build times
- ✅ Event-driven telemetry processing tests pass in CI
- ✅ Quality gate prevents merging of failing tests
- ✅ GitHub UI shows clear status indicators

## Optional Enhancements
- **Code Coverage**: Add JaCoCo reports and coverage badges
- **Security Scanning**: Integrate SAST tools like CodeQL
- **Multi-JDK Testing**: Test against Java 11, 17, and 21
- **Parallel Testing**: Split tests across multiple jobs
- **Performance Testing**: Add load testing for async processors
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for security vulnerabilities
- **Release Automation**: Auto-tagging and GitHub releases
